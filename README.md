# superhack-contracts-and-EAS
This repository contains the smart contracts and scripts used to test the [Teleporter](https://github.com/jvaleskadevs/superchain-teleporter-station) as well as the Ethereum Attestation Service contracts for Superhack, 2023.

Our project, the Superchain Teleporter Station can be found [here](https://github.com/jvaleskadevs/superchain-teleporter-station).

# EAS
The deployment of the EAS and Registry smart contracts to the Zora testnet has been made leveraging our [Teleporter](https://github.com/jvaleskadevs/superchain-teleporter-station), so there was no need for the EAS contracts themselves, but their bytecode via the etherscan API. This repository contains the script used to perform an attestation after deploying and registering an schema using the Zora explorer.
